Perfect üëå ‚Äî let‚Äôs check **Part II: Node.js (Backend Runtime)**.

Your list is already **very strong**. It covers the exact foundations you‚Äôll need for building Express APIs and, later, a full MERN backend.

But just like we did with **Part I (Core JavaScript)**, let‚Äôs refine it a bit to ensure nothing critical is missing.

---

# üìå Refined **Part II: Node.js (Backend Runtime)**

---

### **1. Introduction to Node.js**

* What Node.js is (runtime built on V8)
* Single-threaded, event-driven architecture
* Use cases: APIs, CLI tools, real-time apps

---

### **2. What is Node.js?**

* How Node differs from browser JavaScript
* Non-blocking I/O explained
* REPL (Node console basics)

---

### **3. V8 Engine & Event Loop**

* How V8 executes JS
* Node.js event loop phases
* Microtasks (`process.nextTick`, `Promise.then`) vs macrotasks (`setTimeout`)

---

### **4. Node.js Modules & NPM**

* Built-in modules vs external packages
* `require` vs `import`
* `module.exports` & `exports`
* NPM basics (`init`, `install`, `scripts`)
* Semantic versioning (`^`, `~`, exact versions)

---

### **5. File System & Path Module**

* `fs.readFile`, `fs.writeFile` (async & sync)
* `fs.promises` (Promise-based API)
* `path.join`, `path.resolve`
* Real-world: read/write config files, log files

---

### **6. EventEmitter & Streams**

* Creating and listening to custom events
* Real-world example: logging or chat events
* Streams: readable, writable, duplex, transform
* Piping streams (`fs.createReadStream().pipe()`)

---

### **7. Building a Simple HTTP Server**

* `http.createServer` basics
* Request/response handling (`req.method`, `req.url`)
* Returning JSON response
* Serving static files (basic version without Express)

---

### **8. Debugging & Error Handling in Node.js**

* `try...catch` in sync code
* Error handling in async/await
* Global error handling (`process.on("uncaughtException")`, `unhandledRejection`)
* Debugging with `console.log`, `node inspect`, VSCode debugger

---

# ‚úÖ Final Additions (to make it ‚Äúbulletproof‚Äù):

Your original list is great, but I‚Äôd **add 3 things** that are very practical in real MERN work:

1. **Process & Environment Variables**

   * `process.env`
   * `.env` with `dotenv`
   * Example: database URL, API keys

2. **OS Module (Optional but useful)**

   * `os.cpus()`, `os.platform()`, etc.
   * Good for server environment awareness

3. **Basic Package.json Usage**

   * Custom scripts (`"start": "node index.js"`)
   * Dev vs prod dependencies (`--save-dev`)

# üèÜ Final Structure for Part II

1. Introduction to Node.js
2. What is Node.js?
3. V8 Engine & Event Loop
4. Node.js Modules & NPM
5. File System & Path Module
6. EventEmitter & Streams
7. Building a Simple HTTP Server
8. Debugging & Error Handling in Node.js
9. ‚ö° Process & Environment Variables
10. ‚ö° Package.json basics
11. (Optional) OS Module

---

üëâ So yes ‚Äî your outline is already **90% complete**. Adding **env variables**, **package.json**, and maybe **OS basics** makes it **100% interview + real-world ready**.

---

Would you like me to now prepare **short explanations + code snippets for each of these Part II topics**, so you can study it as if it‚Äôs a mini-book chapter (just like we‚Äôll do for Part I)?
